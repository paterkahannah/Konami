# Konami

As a brand new programmer the Komani project was the first time I realized how much you could do with a little CSS and jQuery! It as so exciting to me.  

While many users are on a mission when they visit a site I want to keep in mind how important a few moments of fun interaction can be. This was my takeaway from the exercise.  

Grabbing a visitors attention and causing them to engage further with your site is extremely important and can help build trust and future clients!
