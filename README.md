# Konami

The Komani project was the first time I realized just how much you could do with a little CSS and jQuery. The gif is a choppy but the page runs much more smoothly and is fun to play with and much more could be added to it. While many website visitors are on a mission I want to keep in mind the fun interactions a user might enjoy. Grabbing a customerâ€™s attention for a few seconds of fun and causing them to engage with your site further can go a long way.
