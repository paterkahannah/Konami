# Konami

The Komani code project was the first time I realized just how much you could do with a little css. The gif is a little choppy but the page runs much more smoothly and is fun to use. While many website visitors are on a mission I want to keep in mind the fun interactions a user might take a few moments to enjoy. Grabbing a customerâ€™s attention for a few seconds of fun and causing them to engage with your site further can go a long way.
