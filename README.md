# Konami

The Komani project was the first time I realized how much you could do with a little CSS and jQuery. The gif is choppy but the actual page runs smoothly and is fun to interact with. Much more could be added but this is just a small example of the potential. While many visitors are on a mission when they visit a site I try to keep in mind how far a few moments of fun user interaction can go. Grabbing a customerâ€™s attention for a few seconds of play and causing them to engage with your site further can be a very valuable thing indeed!
