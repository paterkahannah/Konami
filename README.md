# Konami

The Komani project was the first time I realized how much you could do with a little CSS and jQuery. 

While many users are on a mission when they visit a site I want to keep in mind how important a few moments of fun interaction can be. 

Grabbing a customerâ€™s attention and causing them to engage further with your site is extremely important and can help build trust and future clients!
