# Konami

As a brand new programmer the Komani project was the first time I realized how much you could do with a little CSS and javascript 

While many users are on a mission when they visit a site, a few moments of fun interaction can be very important.

Grabbing a visitors attention and causing them to engage further can help build trust and future clients!
